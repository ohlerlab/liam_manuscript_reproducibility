There might be discrepancies between the path in Jupyter notebook cells and their outputs as I reorganized them for readability. Please consider the paths from the notebook cells and the general organization of this repository.

Scripts for evaluation (iLISI) and publication figures are in the subfolder ```publication_figures/```.

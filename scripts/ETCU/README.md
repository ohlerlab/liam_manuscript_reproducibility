There might be discrepancies between the path in Jupyter notebook cells and their outputs as I reorganized the repository structure for readability. Please consider the paths from the notebook cells and the general organization of this repository.

Data preprocessing: In this directory. All files except for `06_Train_models_seed_extended_use_case_revision_r1.py` and `07_Export_embeddings_from_models.ipynb`.

Model training: In this directory: `06_Train_models_seed_extended_use_case_revision_r1.py`.

Export of embeddings: `07_Export_embeddings_from_models.ipynb`

Evaluation and figures: In subfolder: `publication_figures/`.

Evaluation scores: ```Evaluation/```.
